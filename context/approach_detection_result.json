  "reasoning": "Chain Reflow is a bottom-up integration scenario. The system has existing, functional Python components that implement architecture linking capabilities (creative linking, causality analysis, matryoshka analysis, workflow execution). However, the system itself lacks formal architectural documentation. The next step is bottom-up integration: document the existing components, create architecture graphs for the chain_reflow system itself, and establish the relationships between components.",
