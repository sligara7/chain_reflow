Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. The core concept of machine learning is to enable computers to learn from data. Neural networks are a fundamental architecture in machine learning. A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes. Each node processes information and passes signals to other nodes.

Training a neural network requires data. The data is fed through the network in iterations called epochs. During each epoch, the network adjusts its weights based on the error between predicted and actual outputs. This process is called backpropagation.

Deep learning is an advanced form of machine learning. Deep learning uses deep neural networks with many layers. Each layer extracts different features from the data. The first layer might detect edges in an image. The second layer combines edges to detect shapes. Higher layers detect more complex patterns.

Optimization algorithms are crucial for training networks. Gradient descent is a common optimization algorithm. The algorithm calculates gradients of the error function. These gradients guide the network to minimize error. Learning rate controls how quickly the network adapts.

Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning. Overfitting occurs when the model memorizes training data instead of learning general patterns. Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly disables nodes during training. This forces the network to learn robust features.

Convolutional neural networks excel at image processing. Recurrent neural networks are designed for sequential data. Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing. Each architecture is suited for different types of data and tasks.
