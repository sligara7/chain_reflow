# Integration Requirements Summary

**System**: Chain Reflow System
**Workflow**: 01b-bottom_up_integration
**Step**: BU-02 Integration Requirements Definition
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Approach**: Bottom-up integration of existing components

## Integration Goal

**Primary Goal**: Integrate 5 independent production-ready components into a cohesive architecture linking and workflow execution system.

**Current State**: Components exist independently with no formal integration architecture.

**Target State**: Unified system with formal interfaces, orchestration patterns, and machine-readable architecture specifications.

## System Architecture Pattern

Chain Reflow uses a **layered architecture** with two tiers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         ORCHESTRATION TIER                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • workflow_runner.py (workflow execution)          │
│  • interactive_executor.py (guided setup)           │
│                                                     │
│  Responsibilities:                                  │
│    - Execute multi-step workflows                   │
│    - Manage working memory and state                │
│    - Route between workflow steps                   │
│    - Invoke analysis engines as needed              │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                   │ invokes
                   ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         ANALYSIS TIER                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • creative_linking.py (orthogonal linking)         │
│  • causality_analysis.py (correlation/causation)    │
│  • matryoshka_analysis.py (hierarchical nesting)    │
│                                                     │
│  Responsibilities:                                  │
│    - Analyze architecture relationships             │
│    - Discover touchpoints and gaps                  │
│    - Generate analysis reports                      │
│                                                     │
│  Key Property: Engines are INDEPENDENT              │
│    - Can be used standalone or via orchestration    │
│    - No dependencies on each other                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| I01 | Workflow invokes Creative Linking | ❌ Missing interface |
| I02 | Workflow invokes Causality Analysis | ❌ Missing interface |

| SC07 | Complete documentation | Human + machine specs | Partial ⚠️ |

## Integration Gaps Summary

Based on required interactions and success criteria, the key integration gaps are:

### 1. Missing Formal Interface Specifications

**Problem**: Workflow runner references analysis engines but has no formal interface definitions.

**Impact**: Cannot validate integration, no contract enforcement, unclear API boundaries.

**Required**:
- Interface definitions for each analysis engine
- Parameter schemas and return types
- Error handling contracts

### 2. Missing Service Architecture Files

**Problem**: No machine-readable architecture specifications for any component.

**Impact**: Cannot generate system graph, no automated validation, unclear component boundaries.

**Required**:
- `service_architecture.json` for each of 5 components
- Component capabilities, dependencies, and interfaces documented

### 3. Missing System-of-Systems Graph

**Problem**: No system-level graph showing how components integrate.

**Impact**: Cannot detect orphans, circular dependencies, or architectural inconsistencies.

**Required**:
- `system_of_systems_graph.json` with all components and connections
- Validation that graph is complete and consistent

### 4. Missing Integration Testing

**Problem**: No end-to-end testing of workflow invoking analysis engines.

**Impact**: Unknown whether integration actually works.

**Required**:
- Test harness for workflow execution
- Sample architectures for testing
- Validation of expected outputs

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Working Memory Management

**Components**: workflow_runner, interactive_executor

**Pattern**: Both components read and update `context/working_memory.json` to maintain state across workflow steps.

**Current State**: ✅ Implemented

**Considerations**: Need to ensure atomic updates and conflict resolution if both components run concurrently.

### User Interaction

**Components**: All 3 analysis engines

**Pattern**: Engines accept optional user context and consent parameters.

**Current State**: ✅ Implemented

**Considerations**: Workflow runner must properly pass user input to engines.

### Report Generation

**Components**: All 3 analysis engines

**Pattern**: Each engine generates markdown reports with analysis results.

**Current State**: ✅ Implemented

**Considerations**: Reports follow consistent format with disclaimers and confidence scores.

## Integration Roadmap

### Current Step
✅ **BU-02**: Integration Requirements Definition (COMPLETE)

### Next Steps

1. **BU-03**: Integration Gap Analysis
   - Identify specific integration gaps preventing components from working together
   - Classify gaps by severity
   - Recommend solutions

2. **BU-04**: Component Delta Analysis
   - Generate exact code changes needed for integration
   - Identify new functions, classes, modules required
   - Prioritize component deltas

3. **BU-05**: Integration Architecture Design
   - Design adapters and mediators between tiers
   - Create nested architecture files
   - Define tier-crossing interfaces

4. **BU-06**: Validation & Verification
   - Validate architecture files
   - Generate system-of-systems graph
   - Check for circular dependencies and orphans

### Estimated Complexity
**Medium** - Components are well-designed and independent. Main work is creating formal interface specifications and integration adapters.

## Key Insights

### Strengths of Current Design

1. **Clean Separation**: Orchestration and analysis tiers are well-separated
2. **Independence**: Analysis engines have no dependencies on each other
3. **Production Quality**: All components are complete and functional
4. **Extensibility**: New analysis engines can be added to analysis tier

### Integration Challenges

1. **Informal Interfaces**: Workflow references engines but no formal contracts exist
2. **Missing Specifications**: No machine-readable architecture documentation
3. **Untested Integration**: Unknown whether end-to-end workflow actually works
4. **No Validation**: Cannot verify architectural consistency

### Bottom-Up Integration Pattern

This is a classic bottom-up integration scenario:
- ✅ Functional components exist
- ✅ Human documentation is complete
- ❌ Formal architecture specifications are missing
- ❌ Integration interfaces are undefined
- ❌ System-level validation is impossible

The reflow bottom-up workflow addresses exactly this pattern!

## Next Action

Proceed to **BU-03: Integration Gap Analysis** to formally identify and classify all integration gaps, then generate a resolution roadmap.
