# Chain Reflow System - User Scenarios

**Created:** 2025-10-28

## Scenario 1

Team A develops an axle component architecture, Team B develops a drivetrain architecture. Chain Reflow identifies the touchpoints where they connect.

## Scenario 2

Multiple microservice systems need to be integrated at the system-of-systems level. Chain Reflow analyzes the combined architecture for gaps and inconsistencies.

## Scenario 3

A hierarchical system requires component-level, system-level, and system-of-systems level architecture. Chain Reflow manages the nested relationships.
