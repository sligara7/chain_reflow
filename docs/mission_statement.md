# Chain Reflow System - Mission Statement

**Created:** 2025-10-28
**Framework:** Decision Flow Framework

## Mission

Chain Reflow enables the integration of multiple system-of-systems architectures by discovering and managing touchpoints between independently developed components.

## Purpose

As described in the README, chain_reflow treats each system_of_systems_graph.json as an object that can be linked together in a structured or hierarchical manner. This enables:

- Independent development of system components
- Structured composition of architectures
- Discovery and management of system touchpoints
- Multi-level hierarchical architecture analysis
